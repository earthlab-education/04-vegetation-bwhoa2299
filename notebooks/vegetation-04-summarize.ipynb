It demonstrates that this difference in NDVI between the outside and inside of the community boundary has decreased over time since the restoration of water rights to the community in 2004. This means that while the outside and inside of the boundary contain different NDVI values, either the vegetation within the Gila River Indian Community has become more healthy on average to decrease the gap between it and the outside NDVI values, OR the vegetation outside the Gila River Indian Community has become less healthy on average to decrease this gap. While the first option corresponds more with what is displayed in the previous plot titled \"Mean July NDVI Inside and Outside GRIC,\" a combination of both has most likely produced this effect seen in the difference plot."
